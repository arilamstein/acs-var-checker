This [app](https://acs-var-checker.streamlit.app/) is intended as a companion for people who are working with the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey).

Sometimes variables in the ACS change meaning over time. This can throw off your analysis. This app helps you prevent that problem by showing you all labels assigned to a given variable over the life of the ACS.
